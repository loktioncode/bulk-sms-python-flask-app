# bulk-sms-python-flask-app
This is an application i built with python flask
It has a fully functioning login system and also does crud operations with a sqlite database
I used Html5 and CSS for the responsive front-end.

For u to get to use the app u must have a valid api auth key that will allow you to send texts via your browser
sending sms messages to multiple contacts
